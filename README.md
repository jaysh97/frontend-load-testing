Frontend Load Testing Project
This project demonstrates how to perform basic load testing on a web front page using Apache JMeter. It's designed to showcase performance testing methodologies, metric tracking, and the use of open-source tools for identifying performance bottlenecks.

Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to simulate traffic on a simple front page and monitor its performance under load. This will help in understanding:

Response Times: How quickly the server responds under various load conditions.

Throughput: The number of requests processed per unit of time.

Error Rates: The percentage of failed requests.

Resource Utilization: (Indirectly, by observing server behavior during tests)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Apache JMeter: The primary tool for simulating user load and collecting performance metrics.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the sample front page being tested. (You can integrate your own application's front end here).

Git/GitHub: For version control and project hosting.

 Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher: JMeter requires Java to run.

Download JDK (or use OpenJDK)

Apache JMeter:

Download JMeter (Download the binaries, not the source). Extract it to a convenient location (e.g., C:\apache-jmeter-X.Y or ~/apache-jmeter-X.Y).

2. Setting up the Front Page
The front-page.html file in this repository is a basic example.

You can simply open this file in your browser to see it locally.

For a more realistic test, you might want to serve it using a simple local web server (e.g., Python's http.server, Node.js serve package, or by deploying it to a free hosting service).

Example (Python simple HTTP server):

Navigate to the directory containing front-page.html in your terminal.

Run: python -m http.server 8000

Your front page will then be accessible at http://localhost:8000/front-page.html.

3. Creating the JMeter Test Plan
Refer to the jmeter-test-plan.jmx.md file for detailed steps on how to create your JMeter test plan (.jmx file).

Quick Steps:

Open JMeter (run jmeter.bat on Windows or jmeter on Linux/macOS from the bin directory of your JMeter installation).

Follow the instructions in jmeter-test-plan.jmx.md to build your test plan.

Save your test plan as front_page_load_test.jmx (or a similar name) in the root of this project directory.

🏃 Running the Load Test
Once your JMeter test plan (.jmx file) is created and saved:

Open JMeter.

Open your test plan: File > Open, then navigate to and select your .jmx file.

Run the test: Click the green "Start" button (or Run > Start).

📊 Analyzing Results
After the test run, you can view the results directly in JMeter (e.g., using the "View Results Tree" or "Summary Report" listeners).

Key metrics to analyze:

Average Response Time: The average time taken to receive a response for a request.

Throughput: How many requests per second (or minute) the server can handle.

Error %: Percentage of requests that failed. A high error rate indicates issues.

Standard Deviation: Measures the dispersion of response times. A high standard deviation means response times are highly variable.

Tips for Analysis:

Look for spikes in response times.

Identify if throughput drops significantly under higher load.

Check for any errors and their types.

Correlate test results with server-side monitoring (if available) to understand CPU, memory, and network usage during the test.
